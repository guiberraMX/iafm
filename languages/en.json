    "mig_p1_1": "Is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt, and join. ",
    "mig_p1_2": "Along with the wire electrode, a shielding gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. ",
    "mig_p1_3": "The process can be semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. ",
    "mig_p1_4": "There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, each of which has distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations. ",

    "mig_title4": "MIG FLUX CORE",
    "mig_p3_1": "The FLUX CORE MIG welding is a high technology system that allows to close plates close together or too open. ",
    "mig_p3_2": "This kind of welding reduces at least 50% the application time vs conventional weldings. ",
    "mig_p3_3": "No shielding gas needed with some wires making it suitable for outdoor welding and/or windy conditions. ",

    "tig_p2": "The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by aninert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. ",

    "ele_p2": "The covered electrode is formed by a metallic dipstick (core), usually cylindrical , covered with a coating of non-metallic substances, whose chemical composition is pretty varied.",
    "ele_p3": "The coat could be basic, rutilic or cellulosic. ",
    "ele_p4": "To make an electric arc welding, there is induced a potential difference between the electrode and the piece to weld, this process ionize the air between them and the air becomes conductor, so that the circuit is closed. ",
